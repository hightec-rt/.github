# HighTec

HighTec specializes in safety qualified tools including compilers, using innovative open-source technologies, and real-time operating systems for safety-critical applications in automotive and industrial sectors.

### Core Technologies

- **Compilers & RTOS**: HighTec's GCC and LLVM-based C/C++ compilers are tailored for multi-core and multi-architecture support, emphasizing safety and performance. The PXROS-HR RTOS, certified to ISO 26262 ASIL D / IEC 61508 SIL 3, ensures data protection and robustness.
- **Rust Compiler Development**: HighTec leads with the first ISO 26262 ASIL D qualified Rust Compiler for Infineon AURIX, enhancing security and efficiency in automotive software.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: As a partner for major silicon vendors, HighTec guarantees long-term tool availability and specialized automotive support.

### AURIX™ Rust Startup Ecosystem

The AURIX™ Rust Startup Ecosystem is a collaborative initiative with Infineon, Bluewind, and Veecle. It offers comprehensive tools and software packages for developing and deploying Rust in automotive and industrial applications:
- **Peripheral Access Crate (PAC)** from Infineon enables direct peripheral access tailored for Rust.
- **Rust-specific low-level drivers** from Bluewind, written in native Rust, ensure high-performance.
- **PXROS-HR RTOS with a Rust wrapper**, a precompiled version from HighTec, that simplifies the use of Rust and C/C++ on the AURIX multi-core architecture.
- **Veecle's Rust runtime (NOS)** integrated with PXROS-HR, allows the development of modern, event-driven software in Rust.
- **Combined Compiler Package**: HighTec offers an integrated suite of AURIX Rust and C/C++ compilers, integrated with Cargo, the Rust build system and package manager, to streamline project builds.
- **Example Projects**: A set of ready-to-run projects with different levels, from beginner to advanced, on the TC375 Lite-Kit, including bare metal and RTOS intermix of Rust/C++ tasks, demonstrate the ecosystem’s capabilities and flexibility.
